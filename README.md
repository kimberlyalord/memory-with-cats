# Memory with Cats

This game is a spin-off of the classic memory game, Simon. However, instead of boring red, yellow, blue, and green buttons, there are four adorable cats who will "light up" in sequence. Watch carefully so that you can replicate the sequence!

## Getting Started

To play the game, click [here](https://kimberlyalord.github.io/memory-with-cats/). You will have to click the "Start" button, watch the tile sequence play, and then replicate it by clicking on the appropriate tiles. 

## Future Enhancements

Continue to make improvements to styling and user experience. I originally envisioned the cats as triangle tiles, so I plan to explore the best way to make that presentation happen. I also plan to add sounds to make the game more exciting. Another feature I would like to implement is a cached storage system for scores, so that a player can play multiple times and see their running high score.
